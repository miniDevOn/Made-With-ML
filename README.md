### Mission

ML is **not a separate industry**, instead, it's a powerful **way of thinking** about data, so let's make sure we have a solid foundation before we start changing the world with it. Made With ML is our medium to catalyze this goal and though we're off to great start, we still have a long way to go.

### Who is this content for?
- `Software engineers` looking to learn ML and become even better software engineers.
- `Data scientists` who want to learn how to responsibly deliver value with ML.
- `College graduates` looking to learn the practical skills they'll need for the industry.
- `Product Managers` who want to develop a technical foundation for ML applications.

### What makes this content unique?
- `hands-on`: If you search production ML or MLOps online, you'll find great blog posts and tweets. But in order to really understand these concepts, you need to implement them. Unfortunately, you don‚Äôt see a lot of the inner workings of running production ML because of scale, proprietary content & expensive tools. However, Made With ML is free, open and live which makes it a perfect learning opportunity for the community.
- `intuition-first`: We will never jump straight to code. In every lesson, we will develop intuition for the concepts and think about it from a product perspective.
- `software engineering`: This course isn't just about ML. In fact, it's mostly about clean software engineering! We'll cover important concepts like versioning, testing, logging, etc. that really makes something production-grade product.
- `focused yet holistic`: For every concept, we'll not only cover what's most important for our specific task (this is the case study aspect) but we'll also cover related methods (this is the guide aspect) which may prove to be useful in other situations.

### Who is the author?
- I've built and deployed large scale ML systems at Apple, as well as smaller systems with constraints at startups. I currently work closely with early-stage and F500 companies in helping them deliver value with ML while diving into the best and bespoke practices of this rapidly evolving space. I want to share this knowledge with the rest of the world so we can accelerate progress in this space.

### Why is this free?
While this content is for everyone, it's especially targeted towards people who don't have as much opportunity to learn. I believe that creativity and intelligence are randomly distributed while opportunities are siloed. I want to enable more people to create and contribute to innovation.
